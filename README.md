# D95_quick_installer
a MacOSX shell script that quickly installs the D95 Printer drivers 

this is a simple script that uses the flags 
-up & -dwn to define the IP adress that you want to use

it was made for my use but can be easily tweaked for your own 

it detects what version of OSX you have and installs the driver accordingly 

NOTE I DONT HAVE THE PPD FILE FOR MOST MACOS VERSIONS YOU CAN FIND IT FOR YOUR MACOS VERSION IN:
```/etc/cups/```
